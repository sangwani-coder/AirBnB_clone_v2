# AirBnB clone - Web framework
In this project I will continue working on the Air BnB clone projec, I will be using the Flask web framwork.
Web frameworks are software frameworks that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs.
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
